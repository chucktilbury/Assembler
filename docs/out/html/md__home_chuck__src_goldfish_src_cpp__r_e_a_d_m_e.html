<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>A C preprocessor is a part of a C compiler responsible for macro replacement, conditional compilation and inclusion of header files. It is often found as a stand-alone program on Unix systems.</p>
<p>ucpp is such a preprocessor; it is designed to be quick and light, but anyway fully compliant to the ISO standard 9899:1999, also known as C99. ucpp can be compiled as a stand-alone program, or linked to some other code; in the latter case, ucpp will output tokens, one at a time, on demand, as an integrated lexer.</p>
<p>ucpp operates in two modes: &ndash; lexer mode: ucpp is linked to some other code and outputs a stream of tokens (each call to the <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a466304d609fa54ecc27abe7b2485d9df">lex()</a> function will yield one token) &ndash; non-lexer mode: ucpp preprocesses text and outputs the resulting text to a file descriptor; if linked to some other code, the <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#aa4a3e4042aa543f44d69c552da04143d">cpp()</a> function must be called repeatedly, otherwise ucpp is a stand-alone binary.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
INSTALLATION</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Uncompress the archive file and extract the source files.</li>
<li><p class="startli">Edit <a class="el" href="tune_8h.html">tune.h</a>. Here is a short explanation of compile-time options:</p>
<p class="startli">LOW_MEM Enable memory-saving functions; this is for low-end and old systems, but seems to be good for larger systems too. Keep it. NO_LIBC_BUF NO_UCPP_BUF Two options used to disable the two bufferings inside ucpp. Define both options for maximum memory savings but you will probably want to keep libc buffering for decent performance. Define none on large systems (modern 32 or 64-bit systems). UCPP_MMAP With this option, if ucpp internal buffering is active, ucpp will try to mmap() the input files. This might yield a slight performance improvement, but will work only on a limited set of architectures. PRAGMA_TOKENIZE Make ucpp generate tokenized PRAGMA tokens on #pragma and _Pragma(); tokenization is made this way: tokens are assembled as a null terminated array of unsigned chars; if a token has a string value (as defined by the STRING_TOKEN macro), the value follows the token, terminated by PRAGMA_TOKEN_END (by default, a newline character cast to unsigned char). Whitespace tokens are skipped. The "name" value of the PRAGMA token is a pointer to that array. This setting is irrelevant in non-lexer mode. PRAGMA_DUMP In non-lexer mode, keep #pragma in output; non-void _Pragma() are translated to the equivalent #pragma. Irrelevant in lexer mode. NO_PRAGMA_IN_DIRECTIVE Do not evaluate _Pragma() inside #if, #include, #include_next and #line directives; instead, emit an error (since the remaining _Pragma will surely imply a syntax error). DSHARP_TOKEN_MERGE When two tokens are to be merged with the &lsquo;##&rsquo; operator, but fail because they do not merge into a single valid token, ucpp keeps those two tokens separate by adding an extra space between them in text output. With this option on, that extra space is not added, which means that some tokens may merge partially if the text output is preprocessed again. See <a class="el" href="tune_8h.html">tune.h</a> for details. INMACRO_FLAG In lexer mode, set the inmacro flag to 1 if the current token comes from a macro replacement, 0 otherwise. macro_count maintains an increasing counter of such replacements. CONTEXT tokens count as one macro replacement each. #pragma, and _Pragma() that do not come from a macro replacement, also count as one macro replacement each. This setting is irrelevant in non-lexer mode. STD_INCLUDE_PATH Default include path in stand-alone ucpp. STD_MACROS Default predefined macros in stand-alone ucpp. STD_ASSERT Default assertions in stand-alone ucpp. NATIVE_SIGNED NATIVE_UNSIGNED NATIVE_UNSIGNED_BITS NATIVE_SIGNED_MIN NATIVE_SIGNED_MAX SIMUL_ARITH_SUBTYPE SIMUL_SUBTYPE_BITS SIMUL_NUMBITS WCHAR_SIGNEDNESS Those options define how #if expressions are evaluated; see the cross-compilation section of this file for more info, and the comments in <a class="el" href="tune_8h.html">tune.h</a>. Extra info is found in arith.h and arith.c, at the possible expense of your mental health. DEFAULT_LEXER_FLAGS DEFAULT_CPP_FLAGS Default flags in respectively lexer and non-lexer modes. POSIX_JMP Define this if your architecture defines sigsetjmp() and siglongjmp(); it is known to (very slightly) improve performance on AIX systems. MAX_CHAR_VAL ucpp will consider characters whose value is equal or above MAX_CHAR_VAL as outside the C source charset (so they will be treated just like '@', for instance). For ASCII systems, 128 is fine. 256 is a safer value, but uses more (static) memory. For performance reasons, use a power of two. If MAX_CHAR_VAL is correctly adjusted, ucpp should be compatible with any character set. UNBREAKABLE_SPACE If you want an extra-whitespace character, define this macro to that character. For instance, define this to 160 on an ISO-8859-1 system if you want the 'unbreakable space' to be considered as whitespace. SEMPER_FIDELIS With this option set, ucpp, when used as a lexer, will pass whitespace tokens to its caller, and those tokens will have their true content; this is intended for reconstruction of the source line. Beware that some comments may have embedded newlines. COPY_LINE_LENGTH ucpp can maintain a copy of the current source line, up to that length. Irrelevant to stand-alone version. *_MEMG Those settings modify ucpp behaviour, wrt memory allocations. With higher values, ucpp will perform less <a class="el" href="leak__detector_8h.html#a99aa8fd9f4831e1b0fa9e1cdcde3e249">malloc()</a> calls and will run faster, but it will use more memory. Reduce INPUT_BUF_MEMG and OUTPUT_BUF_MEMG on low-memory systems, if you kept ucpp buffering (see NO_UCPP_BUF option).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Edit the Makefile. You should define the variables CC and FLAGS; there are the following options:</p>
<p class="startli">-DAUDIT Enable internal sanity checks; this slows down a bit ucpp. Do not define unless you plan to debug ucpp. -DMEM_CHECK With this setting, ucpp will check for the return value of <a class="el" href="leak__detector_8h.html#a99aa8fd9f4831e1b0fa9e1cdcde3e249">malloc()</a> and exit with a diagnostic when out of memory. MEM_CHECK is implied by AUDIT. -DMEM_DEBUG Enable memory debug code. This will track memory leaks and several occurrences of memory management errors; it will also slow down things and increase memory consumption, so you probably do not want to use this option. -DINLINE=foobar The ucpp code uses "inline" qualifier for some functions; by default, that qualifier is macro-replaced with nothing. Define INLINE to the correct replacement for your compiler, if supported. Note that all "inline" functions in ucpp are also "static". For any C99-compliant compiler, the GNU compiler (gcc), and the Compaq C compiler under Linux/Alpha, no -DINLINE is needed (see <a class="el" href="tune_8h.html">tune.h</a> for details).</p>
</li>
<li>Compile by typing "make". This should produce the ucpp executable file. You might see some warning messages, especially with gcc: gcc believes some variables might be used prior to their initialization; ignore those messages.</li>
<li>Install wherever you want the binary and the man page ucpp.1. I have not provided an install sequence because I didn't bother.</li>
<li>If you do not have the make utility, compile each file separately and link them together. The exact details depend on your compiler. You must define the macro STAND_ALONE when compiling <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html">cpp.c</a> (there is such a definition, commented out, in <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html">cpp.c</a>, line 34).</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no "configure" script because: &ndash; I do not like the very idea of a "configure" script. &ndash; ucpp is written in ANSI-C and should be fairly portable. &ndash; There is no such thing as "standard" settings for a C preprocessor. The predefined system macros, standard assertions,... must be tuned by the sysadmin. &ndash; The primary goal of ucpp is to be included in compilers. The stand-alone version is mainly a debugging tool.</p>
<p>Please note that you need an ISO-C90 (formerly ANSI) C compiler suite (including the standard library) to compile ucpp. If your compiler is not C99 (or later), read the cross-compilation section in this README file.</p>
<p>The C90 and C99 standards state that external linkage names might be considered equal or different based upon only their first 6 characters; this rule might make ucpp not compile on a conformant C implementation. I have yet to see such an implementation, however.</p>
<p>If you want to use ucpp as an integrated preprocessor and lexer, see the section REUSE. Compiling ucpp as a library is an exercise left to the reader.</p>
<p>With the LOW_MEM code enabled, ucpp can run on a Minix-i86 or Msdos 16-bit small-memory-model machine. It will not be fully compliant on such an architecture to C99, since C99 states that at least one source code with 4095 simultaneously defined macros must be processed; ucpp will be limited to about 1500 macros (at most) due to memory restrictions. At least ucpp can preprocess its own code in these conditions. LOW_MEM is on by default because it seems to improve performance on large systems.</p>

LICENSE</h1>
<p>The copyright notice and license is at the beginning of the Makefile and each source file. It is basically a BSD license, without the advertising subclause (which BSD dropped recently anyway) and with no reference to Berkeley (since the code is all mine, written from scratch). Informally, this means that you can reuse and redistribute the code as you want, provided that you state in the documentation (or any substantial part of the software) of redistributed code that I am the original author. (If you press a cdrom with 200 software packages, I do not insist on having my name on the cover of the cdrom &ndash; just keep a Readme file somewhere on the cdrom, with the copyright notice included.)</p>
<p>As a courteous gesture, if you reuse my code, please drop me a mail. It raises my self-esteem.</p>

REUSE</h1>
<p>The code has been thought as part of a bigger project; it might be used as an integrated lexer, that will read files, process them as a C preprocessor, and output a stream of C tokens. To include this code into a project, compile with STAND_ALONE undefined.</p>
<p>To use the preprocessor and lexer, several steps should be performed. See the file '<a class="el" href="sample_8c.html">sample.c</a>' for an example.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a60b8bfd867ca9cd5ad3bc51fffabeeba">init_cpp()</a>. This function initializes the lexer automaton.</li>
<li>set the following global variables: no_special_macros non-zero if the special macros (<b>FILE</b> and others) should not be defined. This is a global flag since it affects the redefinition of such macros (which are allowed if the special macros are not defined) c99_compliant if non-zero, define <b>STDC_VERSION</b> to 199901L; this is the default; otherwise, do not define <b>STDC_VERSION</b>. Note that ucpp will accept to undefine <b>STDC_VERSION</b> with a #undef directive. c99_hosted if strictly positive, define <b>STDC_HOSTED</b> to 1. If zero, define <b>STDC_HOSTED</b> to 0. If negative, do not define <b>STDC_HOSTED</b>. The default is 1. emit_defines and emit_assertions should be set to 0 for the step 3.</li>
<li>call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#ab9481fa5ec58616f35b96945b27e6dfb">init_tables()</a>. This function initializes the macro table and other things; it will intialize assertions if it has a non-zero argument.</li>
<li>call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a714e0a8a31d45efbac548caff2069b68">init_include_path()</a>. This function will reset the include path to the list of paths given as argument.</li>
<li>set the following global variables emit_dependencies set to 1 if dependencies should be emitted during preprocessing set to 2 if dependencies should also be emitted for system include files emit_defines set to non-zero if #define macro definitions should be emitted when macros are defined emit_assertions set to non-zero if #define macro definitions should be emitted when macros are defined emit_output the FILE * where the above items are sent if one of the three emit_ variables is set to non zero transient_characters this is for some cross-compilation; see the relevant part in this README file for details</li>
<li>call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#ae92b628d41ae25bec21a0cdb68b7cbd9">set_init_filename()</a> with the initial filename as argument; the second argument indicates whether the filename is real or conventional ("real" means "an fopen() on it will work").</li>
<li>initialize your struct <a class="el" href="structlexer__state.html">lexer_state</a>: call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a511cc7122574e1d2ebc4c89ad6ccce09">init_lexer_state()</a> call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#af2943bfb075ab4f300712ed20ba821a4">init_lexer_mode()</a> if the preprocessor is supposed to output a list of tokens, otherwise set the flags field to DEFAULT_CPP_FLAGS and set the output field to the FILE * where output should be sent (<a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#af2943bfb075ab4f300712ed20ba821a4">init_lexer_mode()</a>, if called at all, must be called after <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a511cc7122574e1d2ebc4c89ad6ccce09">init_lexer_state()</a>) adjust the flags field; here is the meaning of flags:</li>
</ol>
<p>WARN_STANDARD emit the standard warnings WARN_ANNOYING emit the useless and annoying warnings WARN_TRIGRAPHS count trigraphs encountered; it is up to the caller to emit a warning if some trigraphs were indeed encountered; the count is stored in the count_trigraphs field of the struct <a class="el" href="structlexer__state.html">lexer_state</a> WARN_TRIGRAPHS_MORE emit a warning for each trigraph encountered WARN_PRAGMA emit a warning for each non-void _Pragma encountered in non-lexer mode (because these are dumped as #pragma in the output) and for each #pragma too, if ucpp was compiled without PRAGMA_DUMP FAIL_SHARP emit errors on '#' tokens beginning a line and not followed by a valid cpp directive CCHARSET emit errors when non-C characters are encountered; if this flag is not set, each non-C character will be considered as a BUNCH token (since C99 states that non-C characters are allowed as long as they "disappear" during preprocessing [through macro replacement and stringification for instance], this flag must not be set, for maximum C99 compliance) DISCARD_COMMENTS do not keep comments in output (irrelevant in lexer mode) CPLUSPLUS_COMMENTS understand new style comments (//) (mandatory for C99) LINE_NUM emit #line directives when entering a file, if not in lexer mode; emit CONTEXT token in lexer mode for #line and new files GCC_LINE_NUM if LINE_NUM is set, emit gcc-like directives instead of #line HANDLE_ASSERTIONS understand assertions in #if expressions (and <a class="el" href="structassert.html">assert</a>, #unassert) HANDLE_PRAGMA make PRAGMA tokens for #pragma; irrelevant in non-lexer mode (handling of some pragmas is required in C99 but is not of the competence of the preprocessor; without this flag, ucpp will ignore the contents of #pragma and _Pragma directives) MACRO_VAARG understand macros with a variable number of arguments (mandatory for C99) UTF8_SOURCE understand UTF-8 encoding: multibyte characters are considered equivalent to letters as far as syntax is concerned (they can be used in identifiers) LEXER act as a lexer, outputting tokens TEXT_OUTPUT this flag should be set to 0 if ucpp works as a lexer, 1 otherwise. It is somehow redundant with the LEXER flag, but the presence of those two different flags is needed in ucpp. KEEP_OUTPUT in non-lexer mode, emit the result of preprocessing COPY_LINE maintain a copy of the last read line in the copy_line field of the struct <a class="el" href="structlexer__state.html">lexer_state</a> ; see below for how to use this buffer HANDLE_TRIGRAPHS understand trigraphs, such as ??/ for . This option should be set by default, except for some legacy code.</p>
<p>There are other flags, but they are for private usage of ucpp.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>adjust the input field in the <a class="el" href="structlexer__state.html">lexer_state</a> to the FILE * from where source file is read. If you use the UCPP_MMAP compile-time option, and your input file is eligible to mmap(), then you can call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a64fd804b94619c493c34a13c7ce9f6af">fopen_mmap_file()</a> to open it, then <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a9d0310063cca008e4be247649574729a">set_input_file()</a> to set ls-&gt;input and some other internal options. Do not call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a9d0310063cca008e4be247649574729a">set_input_file()</a> unless you just called <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a64fd804b94619c493c34a13c7ce9f6af">fopen_mmap_file()</a> just before on the same file.</li>
<li>call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a0785acca550ee1153d490f9db1484afa">add_incpath()</a> to add an include path, <a class="el" href="cpp_8h.html#a24e402dd9023b3da09022a6d600259ff">define_macro()</a> and <a class="el" href="cpp_8h.html#a55777fcb82c3e76dafc18945673c5ba7">undef_macro()</a> to add or remove macros, <a class="el" href="assert_8c.html#acfbf8143755bc55a2f4f1a3f1838114f">make_assertion()</a> and <a class="el" href="assert_8c.html#a575a69b5cf070470314665ea73359f14">destroy_assertion()</a> to add or remove assertions.</li>
<li>call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a8bac965baa862f8d89afa97a2d6925a4">enter_file()</a> (this is needed only in non-lexer mode, or if LINE_NUM is set).</li>
</ol>
<p>Afterwards:</p>
<p>&ndash; if you are in lexer mode, call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a466304d609fa54ecc27abe7b2485d9df">lex()</a>; each call will make the ctok field point to the next token. A non-zero return value is an error. <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a466304d609fa54ecc27abe7b2485d9df">lex()</a> skips whitespace tokens. The memory used by the string value of some tokens (identifiers, numbers...) is automatically freed, so copy the contents of each such token if you want to keep it (tokens with a string content are identified by the STRING_TOKEN macro applied to their type). When <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a466304d609fa54ecc27abe7b2485d9df">lex()</a> returned a non-zero value: if it is CPPERR_EOF, then end-of-input was reached. Otherwise, it is a genuine error and ls-&gt;ctok is an undefined token; skip it and call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a466304d609fa54ecc27abe7b2485d9df">lex()</a> again to ignore the error.</p>
<p>&ndash; otherwise, call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#aa4a3e4042aa543f44d69c552da04143d">cpp()</a>; each call will analyze one or more tokens (one token if it did find neither a cpp directive nor a macro name). A positive return value is an error.</p>
<p>For both functions, if the return value is CPPERR_EOF (which is a strictly positive value), then it means that the end of file was reached. Call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#acb91093a179eae609afbd6c900c00b74">check_cpp_errors()</a> after end of file for pending errors (unfinished #if constructions for instance). In non-lexer mode, call <a class="el" href="cpp_8h.html#a6b4978087adcae0273ad3d68503b1fe0">flush_output()</a>.</p>
<p>In the struct <a class="el" href="structlexer__state.html">lexer_state</a>, the following fields might be read: line the current input line number oline the current output line number (in non-lexer mode) flags the flags described above count_trigraphs the number of trigraphs encountered inmacro the current token comes from a macro macro_count the current macro counter "flags" is an unsigned long and might be modified; the three others are of long type.</p>
<p>To perform another preprocessing: use <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#ab819e35c7e26aaa1826068d1d09271b6">free_lexer_state()</a> to release memory used by the buffers referenced in <a class="el" href="structlexer__state.html">lexer_state</a>, and go back to step 2. The different tables (macros, assertions...) should be reset to their respective initial contents.</p>
<p>There is also the <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a9c173dc268b26e643c5a8014ff5890cd">wipeout()</a> function: when called, it should release (almost) all memory blocks allocated dynamically. After a <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a9c173dc268b26e643c5a8014ff5890cd">wipeout()</a>, ucpp should be back to its state at step 2 (<a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a60b8bfd867ca9cd5ad3bc51fffabeeba">init_cpp()</a> initializes only static tables, that are never freed nor modified afterwards).</p>
<p>The COPY_LINE buffer: the struct <a class="el" href="structlexer__state.html">lexer_state</a> contains two interesting fields, copy_line[] and cli. If the COPY_LINE flag is on, each read line is stored in this buffer, up to (at most) COPY_LINE_LENGTH - 1 characters (COPY_LINE_LENGTH is defined in <a class="el" href="tune_8h.html">tune.h</a>). The last character of the buffer is always a zero, and if the line was read entirely, it is zero terminated; the trailing newline is not included.</p>
<p>The purpose of this buffer is error-reporting. When an error occurs (<a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#aa4a3e4042aa543f44d69c552da04143d">cpp()</a> returns a strictly positive value, or <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a466304d609fa54ecc27abe7b2485d9df">lex()</a> returns a non-zero value), if your struct <a class="el" href="structlexer__state.html">lexer_state</a> is called ls, use this code: </p><pre class="fragment">if (ls.cli != 0) ls.copy_line[ls.cli] = 0;
</pre><p> This will add a trailing 0 if the line was not read entirely.</p>
<p>ucpp may be configured at runtime to accept alternate characters as possible parts of identifiers. Typical intended usage is for the '$' and '@' characters. The two relevant functions are <a class="el" href="cpp_8h.html#ab7b86bea38f579b510df2ad903b2a9d7">set_identifier_char()</a> and <a class="el" href="cpp_8h.html#afe97619e8980eeef213612d0ee9ee611">unset_identifier_char()</a>. When this call is issued: set_identifier_char('$'); then for all the remaining input, the '$' character will be considered as just another letter, as far as identifier tokenizing is concerned. This is for identifiers only; numeric constants are not modified by that setting. This call resets things back: unset_identifier_char('$'); Those two functions modify the static table which is initialized by <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a60b8bfd867ca9cd5ad3bc51fffabeeba">init_cpp()</a>. You may call <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html#a60b8bfd867ca9cd5ad3bc51fffabeeba">init_cpp()</a> at any time to restore the table to its standard state.</p>
<p>When using this feature, take care of the following points:</p>
<p>&ndash; Do NOT use a character whose numeric value (as an &lsquo;unsigned char&rsquo; cast into an &lsquo;int&rsquo;) is greater than or equal to MAX_CHAR_VAL (in <a class="el" href="tune_8h.html">tune.h</a>). This would lead to unpredictable results, including an abrupt crash of ucpp. ucpp makes absolutely no check whatsoever on that matter: this is the programmer's responsibility.</p>
<p>&ndash; If you use a standard character such as '+' or '{', tokens which begin with those characters cease to exist. This can be troublesome. If you use <a class="el" href="cpp_8h.html#ab7b86bea38f579b510df2ad903b2a9d7">set_identifier_char()</a> on the '&lt;' character, the handling of #include directives will be greatly disturbed. Therefore the use of any standard C character in <a class="el" href="cpp_8h.html#ab7b86bea38f579b510df2ad903b2a9d7">set_identifier_char()</a> of <a class="el" href="cpp_8h.html#afe97619e8980eeef213612d0ee9ee611">unset_identifier_char()</a> is declared unsupported, forbidden and altogether unwise.</p>
<p>&ndash; Stricto sensu, when an extra character is declared as part of an identifier, ucpp behaviour cease to conform to C99, which mandates that characters such as '$' or '@' must be treated as independant tokens of their own. Therefore, if your purpose is to use ucpp in a conformant C implementation, the use of <a class="el" href="cpp_8h.html#ab7b86bea38f579b510df2ad903b2a9d7">set_identifier_char()</a> should be made at least a runtime option.</p>
<p>&ndash; When enabling a new character in the middle of a macro replacement, the effect of that replacement may be delayed up to the end of that macro (but this is a "may" !). If you wish to trigger this feature with a custom #pragma or _Pragma(), you should remember it (for instance, usine _Pragma() in a macro replacement, and then the extra character in the same macro replacement, is not reliable).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
COMPATIBILITY NOTES</h1>
<p>The C language has a lengthening history. Nowadays, C comes in three flavours:</p>
<p>&ndash; Traditional C, aka "K&amp;R". This is the language first described by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, and implemented in the first C compiler that was ever coded. There are actually several dialects of K&amp;R, and all of them are considered deprecated.</p>
<p>&ndash; ISO 9899:1990, aka C90, aka C89, aka ANSI-C. Formalized by ANSI in 1989 and adopted by ISO the next year, it is the C flavour many C compilers understand. It is mostly backward compatible with K&amp;R C, but with enhancements, clarifications and several new features.</p>
<p>&ndash; ISO 9899:1999, aka C99. This is an evolution on C90, almost fully backward compatible with C90. C99 introduces many new and useful features, however, including in the preprocessor.</p>
<p>There was also a normative addendum in 1995, that added a few features to C90 (for instance, digraphs) that are also present in C99. It is sometimes refered to as "C95" or "AMD 1".</p>
<p>ucpp implements the C99 standard, but can be used in a stricter mode, to enforce C90 compatibility (it will, however, still recognize some constructions that are not in plain C90).</p>
<p>ucpp also knows about several extensions to C99:</p>
<p>&ndash; Assertions: this is an extension to the defined() operator, with its own namespace. Assertions seem to be used in several places, therefore ucpp knows about them. It is recommended to enable assertions by default on Solaris systems. &ndash; Unicode: the C99 norm specifies that extended characters, from the ISO-10646 charset (aka "unicode") can be used in identifiers with the notations \u and \U. ucpp also accepts (with the proper flag) the UTF-8 encoding in the source file for such characters. &ndash; #include_next directive: it works as a #include, but will look for files only in the directories specified in the include path after the one the current file was found. This is a GNU-ism that is useful for writing transparent wrappers around header files.</p>
<p>Assertions and unicode are activated by specific flags; the #include_next support is always active.</p>
<p>The ucpp code itself should be compatible with any ISO-C90 compiler. The <a class="el" href="cpp_8c.html">cpp.c</a> file is rather big (~ 64kB), it might confuse old 16-bit C compilers; the <a class="el" href="macro_8c.html">macro.c</a> file is somewhat large also (~ 47kB).</p>
<p>The evaluation of #if expressions is subject to some subtleties, see the section "cross-compilation".</p>
<p>The lexer code makes no assumption about the source character set, but the following: source characters (those which have a syntactic value in C; comment and string literal contents are not concerned) must have a strictly positive value that is strictly lower than MAX_CHAR_VAL. The strict positivity is already assured by the C standard, so you just need to adjust MAX_CHAR_VAL.</p>
<p>ucpp has been tested succesfully on ASCII/ISO-8859-1 and EBCDIC systems. Beware that UTF-8 is NOT compatible with EBCDIC.</p>
<p>Pragma handling: when used in non-lexer mode, ucpp tries to output a source text that, when read again, will yield the exact same stream of tokens. This is not completely true with regards to line numbering in some tricky macro replacements, but it should work correctly otherwise, especially with pragma directives if the compile-time option PRAGMA_DUMP was set: #pragma are dumped, non-void _Pragma() are converted to the corresponding #pragma and dumped also.</p>
<p>ucpp does not macro-replace the contents of #pragma and _Pragma(); If you want a macro-replaced pragma, use this:</p>
<p>#define pragma_(x) <em>Pragma(#x) #define pragma(x) pragma</em>(x)</p>
<p>Anyway, pragmas do not nest (an _Pragma() cannot be evaluated if it is inside a #pragma or another _Pragma).</p>
<p>I wrote ucpp according to what is found in "The C Programming Language" from Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (2nd edition) and the C99 standard; but I could have misinterpreted some points. On some tricky points I got help from the helpful people from the comp.std.c newsgroup. For assertions and #include_next, I mimicked the behaviour of GNU cpp, as is stated in the GNU cpp info documentation. An open question is related to the following code:</p>
<p>#define undefined ! #define makeun(x) un ## x #if makeun(defined foo) qux #else bar #endif</p>
<p>ucpp will replace 'defined foo' with 0 first (since foo is not defined), then it will replace the macro makeun, and the expression will become 'un0', which is replaced by 0 since this is a remaining identifier. The expression evaluates to false, and 'bar' is emitted. However, some other preprocessors will replace makeun first, considering that it is not part of a 'defined' operator application; this will produce the macro 'undefined', which is replaced, and the expression becomes '!foo'. 'foo' is replaced by 0, the expression evaluates to true, and 'qux' is emitted.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the behaviour is undefined, because use of the 'defined' operator does not match an allowed form prior to macro replacement (I mean, its syntax matches, but its use is reconverted to inexistant and therefore is not anymore matching). Other people think that the behaviour is well-specified, and contrary to what ucpp does. The only thing clear to me is that the wording of the standard (paragraph 6.10.1.3) is unclear.</p>
<p>Since the ucpp behaviour makes ucpp code simpler and cleaner, and that it is unlikely that any real-life code would ever be disturbed by that interpretation of the standard, ucpp will keep its current behaviour until convincing evidence of my misinterpretation of the standard is given to me. The problem can only occur if one uses ## to make a 'defined' operator disappear from a #if expression (everybody agrees that the generation of a 'defined' operator triggers undefined behaviour).</p>
<p>Another point about macro replacement has been discussed at length in several occasions. It is about the following code:</p>
<p>#define CAT(a, b) CAT_(a, b) #define CAT_(a, b) a ## b #define AB(x, y) CAT(x, y) CAT(A, B)(X, Y)</p>
<p>ucpp will produce &lsquo;CAT(X,Y)&rsquo; as replacement for the last line, whereas some other preprocessors output &lsquo;XY&rsquo;. The answer to the question "which behaviour is correct" seems to be "this is not defined by the
C standard". It is the answer that has been actually given by the C standardization committee in 1992, to the defect report #017, question 23, which asked that very same question. Since the wording of the standard has not changed in these parts from the 1990 to the 1999 version, the preprocessor behaviour on the above-stated code should still be considered as undefined.</p>
<p>It seems, however, that there used to be a time (around 1988) when the committee members agreed upon a precise macro-replacement algorithm, which specified quite clearly the preprocessor behaviour in such situation. ucpp behaviour is occasionnaly claimed as "incorrect" with regards to that algorithm. Since that macro replacement algorithm has never been published, and the committee itself backed out from it in 1992, I decided to disregard those feeble claims.</p>
<p>It is possible, however, that at some point in the future I rewrite the ucpp macro replacement code, since that code is a bit messy and might be made to use less memory in some occasions. It is then possible that, in the aftermath of such a rewrite, the ucpp behaviour for the above stated code become tunable. Don't hold your breath, though.</p>
<p>About _Pragma: the standard is not clear about when this operator is evaluated, and if it is allowed inside #if directives and such. For ucpp, I coded _Pragma as a special macro with lazy replacement: it will be evaluated wherever a macro could be replaced, and only at the end of the macro replacement (for practical purposes, _Pragma can be considered as a macro taking one argument, and being replaced by nothing, except for some tricky uses of the # and ## operators). This means that, by default, ucpp will evaluate _Pragma inside some directives (mainly, #if, #include, #include_next and #line), but it can be taught not to do so by defining NO_PRAGMA_IN_DIRECTIVE in <a class="el" href="tune_8h.html">tune.h</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
CROSS-COMPILATION</h1>
<p>If compiled with a C99 development suite, ucpp should be fully C99-compliant on the host platform (up to my own understanding of the standard &ndash; remember that this software is distributed as-is, without any guarantee). However, if a pre-C99 compiler is used, or if the target machine is not the host machine (for instance when you build a cross-compiler), the evaluation of #if expressions is subject to some cross-compiling issues:</p>
<p>&ndash; character constants: when evaluating expressions, character constants are interpreted in the source character set context; this is allowed by the standard but this can lead to problems with code that expects this interpretation to match the one made in the C code. To ease cross-compilation, you can define a conversion array, and make the global variable transient_characters point to it. The array should contain 256 int; transient_characters[x] is the value of the character whose value is x in the source character set.</p>
<p>This facility is provided for inclusion of ucpp inside another code; if you want a stand-alone ucpp with that conversion, hard-code the conversion table into <a class="el" href="eval_8c.html">eval.c</a> and make transient_characters[] statically point to it. Alternatively, you could provide an option syntax to provide such a table on command-line, if you feel like it.</p>
<p>&ndash; wide character constants signedness: by default, ucpp makes wide characters as signed as what plain chars are on the build host. To force wide character constant signedness, define WCHAR_SIGNEDNESS to 0 (for unsigned) or 1 (for signed). Beware, however, that "native" wide character constants, even signed, are considered positive. Non-wide character constants are, according to the C99 standard, of type int, and therefore always signed.</p>
<p>&ndash; evaluation type: C90 states that all constants in #if expressions are considered as either long or unsigned long, and that the evaluation is performed with operands of that size. In C99, the situation is equivalent, except that the types used are intmax_t and uintmax_t, as defined in &lt;stdint.h&gt;.</p>
<p>ucpp can use two expression evaluators: one uses native integer types (one signed and one unsigned), the other evaluator emulates big integer numbers by representing them with two values of some unsigned type. The emulated type handles signed values in two's complement representation, and can be any width ranging from 2 bits to twice the size of the underlying native unsigned type used. An odd width is allowed. When right shifting an emulated signed negative value, it is left-padded with bits set to 1 (this is sign extension).</p>
<p>When the ARITHMETIC_CHECKS macro is defined in <a class="el" href="tune_8h.html">tune.h</a>, all occurrences of implementation-defined or undefined behaviour during arithmetic evaluation are reported as errors or warned upon. This includes all overflows and underflows on signed quantities, constants too large, and so on. Errors (which terminate immediately evaluation) are emitted for division by 0 (on / and % operators) and overflow (on / operator); otherwise, warnings are emitted and the faulty evaluation takes place. This prevents ucpp from crashing on typical x86 machines, while still allowing to use some extensions.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
FUTURE EVOLUTIONS</h1>
<p>ucpp is quite complete now. There was a longstanding project of "traditional" preprocessing, but I dropped it because it would not map cleanly on the token-based ucpp structure. Maybe I will code a string-based preprocessor one day; it would certainly use some of the code from <a class="el" href="lexer_8c.html">lexer.c</a>, <a class="el" href="eval_8c.html">eval.c</a>, <a class="el" href="mem_8c.html">mem.c</a> and <a class="el" href="nhash_8c.html">nhash.c</a>. However, making such a tool is almost irrelevant nowadays. If one wants to handle such project, using ucpp as code base, I would happily provide some help, if needed.</p>
